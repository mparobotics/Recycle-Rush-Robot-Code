So I (Wilke) Don't go insane with comments in code

- %%% Vocabulary and definitions. If you don't know a word it will most likley be here
- NCIU (Not currently in use (will be taken out in optimized code, however for ease of reading and understanding structure they are in))
- Pointers: The little asterisk, don't concern yourself about this to much unless you are a coder in which case just use google.
- Autonomus: the start of the game, where the robot runs pre-determined commands and there is no user control
- Teleoperation: the time of the game where drivers step forward and take control of the robot
- Deadzone: A space where there may be input, but nothing will be activated to make sure it wasn't by accident
